    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Lit - Financial Independence Progress Tracker. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Lit mobile application ("App", "Service", "we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, then you may not access the Service.
    </p>
    
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By creating an account, accessing, or using Lit, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date and/or displaying a notice in the App. Your continued use of the Service after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lit is an educational tool designed to help users understand and track their progress toward Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). The App provides calculations, projections, and visualizations based on user-provided financial data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Service includes features such as account tracking, FIRE number calculations, progress meters, investment projections, and educational content about financial independence concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lit is provided for educational and informational purposes only. It is NOT financial advice, investment advice, tax advice, legal advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities or financial products.
    </p>
    
    <h2>3. User Accounts and Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
        To use certain features of the Service, you must create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials (email and password) and for all activities that occur under your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for the accuracy of all financial data you enter into the App, including account balances, expenses, investment amounts, and other financial information.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to: (a) use the Service in any way that violates any applicable law or regulation; (b) impersonate or attempt to impersonate another user; (c) interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers connected to the Service; (d) use any automated means to access the Service without our express written permission; (e) attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Service or any other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the Service.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Educational Tool Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        Lit is an educational tool only. All calculations, projections, estimates, and information provided by the App are for educational and informational purposes and are not intended as financial, investment, tax, or legal advice.
    </p>
    <p>
        We make no guarantees, warranties, or representations about: (a) the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any calculations or projections; (b) future investment returns or market performance; (c) the achievement of any financial goals or FIRE timeline; (d) the suitability of any strategy for your personal financial situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Past performance does not guarantee future results. Historical market returns (e.g., average annual returns) are not predictions of future performance and should not be relied upon as such.
    </p>
    <p>
        All investments carry risk, including the potential loss of principal. Market conditions can fluctuate significantly and may result in losses that affect your ability to reach FIRE.
    </p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that any financial decisions you make are your sole responsibility and that you will not hold Lit liable for any outcomes resulting from such decisions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your financial data. The App relies on the data you provide, and inaccurate or outdated data will produce inaccurate calculations and projections.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your financial data is stored securely using Firebase Firestore (Google Cloud) and locally on your device using AsyncStorage. While we implement reasonable security measures, you acknowledge that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and for backing up your data. We are not responsible for any loss of data due to device failure, loss, theft, or damage.
    </p>
    
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The Service uses third-party services, including but not limited to: (a) Firebase (Google) for authentication and data storage; (b) other third-party services as may be necessary to provide the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firebase services are provided by Google LLC. By using the Service, you also agree to comply with Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy as they relate to Firebase.
    </p>
    
    <h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>

        The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Lit and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.

        You retain ownership of any financial data you provide to the Service. By providing data to the Service, you grant us a license to use, store, and process such data as necessary to provide the Service.
    </p>
    
    <h2>8. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>
        Certain features of the Service may require a paid subscription. If you purchase a subscription, you agree to pay the applicable fees as displayed at the time of purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subscription fees are charged in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annually, as selected). Your subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled before the renewal date.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or through the app store where you purchased the subscription. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and you will continue to have access to paid features until that time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Refund policies are governed by the app store through which you purchased the subscription (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not provide direct refunds.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to change subscription prices with reasonable notice. Price changes will not affect your current subscription period but will apply to subsequent renewals.
    </p>
    
    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LIT, ITS CREATORS, AFFILIATES, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION: (a) LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES; (b) FINANCIAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SERVICE; (c) INVESTMENT DECISIONS MADE BASED ON PROJECTIONS OR CALCULATIONS PROVIDED BY THE SERVICE; (d) ERRORS, INACCURACIES, OR OMISSIONS IN THE SERVICE; (e) INTERRUPTIONS, BUGS, OR TECHNICAL ISSUES.

    </p>
    <p>
