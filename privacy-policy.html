    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculate your FIRE progress and financial projections</li>
        <li>Provide personalized financial insights and recommendations</li>
        <li>Sync your data across devices when you're logged in</li>

        <li>Process subscription payments and manage your premium account</li>
        <li>Send important updates about your account or the app</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored securely using Firebase (Google Cloud Platform). We use industry-standard encryption 
        to protect your information both in transit and at rest. Your financial data is stored in a secure database 
        and is only accessible to you when you're logged in.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with 
        our services. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within 30 days, 
        except where we are required to retain it for legal or regulatory purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Financial data and calculations are retained to maintain your FIRE progress history. You can request 
        deletion of your data at any time by contacting us or using the account deletion feature in the app.
    </p>
    
    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Your data may be stored and processed in countries outside of your country of residence, including 
        the United States, where our service providers (such as Firebase/Google Cloud Platform) operate. 
        These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your country.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using our app, you consent to the transfer of your data to these countries. We take appropriate 
        measures to ensure your data is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy regardless of where 
        it is stored.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        We use Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with our app. This helps us improve 
        features and fix issues. The analytics data collected includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>App usage and feature interactions</li>
        <li>App performance metrics (crashes, errors)</li>
        <li>Device information (type, OS version)</li>
        <li>General location data (country/region level, not precise location)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is aggregated and anonymized. We do not use this data to personally identify you. 
        You can opt out of analytics data collection through your device settings, though this may 
        limit our ability to improve the app.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Breach Notification</h2>
    <p>
        In the event of a data breach that compromises your personal information, we will notify you 
        and relevant authorities as required by applicable law. We will notify you via email to the 
        address associated with your account within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, 
        unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.
    </p>
